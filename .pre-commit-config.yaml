# Pre-commit configuration for OPM Simulators
# This configuration uses the pre-commit framework to automatically format source files
# before commits, ensuring consistent code style across the project.
#
# Installation:
# -------------
# 1. Install pre-commit (choose one method):
#    - Via pip: pip install pre-commit
#    - Via conda: conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
#    - Via homebrew (macOS): brew install pre-commit
#    - Via package manager (Ubuntu/Debian): apt install pre-commit
#
# 2. Install the hooks in your local repository:
#    pre-commit install
#
# Usage:
# ------
# - Hooks run automatically on every commit
# - To run manually on all files: pre-commit run --all-files
# - To run on specific files: pre-commit run --files <file1> <file2>
# - To skip hooks for a commit: git commit --no-verify
# - To update hook versions: pre-commit autoupdate
#
# What these hooks do:
# -------------------
# - trailing-whitespace: Removes trailing whitespace from lines
#   (preserves Markdown hard line breaks with --markdown-linebreak-ext=md)
# - end-of-file-fixer: Ensures files end with exactly one newline
#
