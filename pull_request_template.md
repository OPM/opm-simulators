Remember to tag the Pull Request with one of the manual: labels, this is required to merge a PR.

Delete this template text and make a description of the PR that explains its user relevance,
unless this is a small technical fix that in no way affects the user (tagged with manual:irrelevant).

The description must always have a description of the technical content, even if it is just something like "fixed typo in comment".
