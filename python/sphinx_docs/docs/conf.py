# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------
import os
import sys

# For regular Python packages, the path to the package is usually added to sys.path
# here such that autodoc can find the modules. However, our Python module
#  opm.simulators.BlackOilSimulator is not generated yet. Since it is a pybind11
# extension module, it needs to be compiled as part of the opm-simulators build
# process (which requires building opm-common first and so on). The full compilation
# of opm-simulators requres time and storage resources, so we do not want to
# do this as part of the documentation build. Instead, we will use a sphinx extension
# (Python script) to generate documentation from a JSON input file. (This JSON file
# is also is also used to generate a C++ header file with docstrings. The header file
# is generated when opm-simulators is built and is then included
# in the pybind11 binding code for the BlackOilSimulator class. In this way, the
# opm.simulators.BlackOilSimulator Python module will also have access to the docstrings.)
