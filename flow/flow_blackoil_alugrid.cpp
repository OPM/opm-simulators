// By default, dune-ALUGrid uses Space-Filling Curve (SFC) ordering
// for cells to optimize data access patterns for adaptive mesh refinements/coarsening.
// However, if you want to use Cartesian ordering, as is used in OPM, you
// can switch to it by defining the macro #define DISABLE_SFC_ORDERING 1.
// This will change the default cell order to Cartesian.
// Note that this option is not available for pre-built or installed versions of dune-ALUGrid.
// To enable changig to Cartesian ordering, you will need to rebuild dune-ALUGrid from source, ensuring 
// the build configuration allows disabling SFC ordering from OPM.
// For more details, refer to the files gridfactory.hh and aluinline.hh located in the dune-alugrid/3d/
