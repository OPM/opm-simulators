/// This class serves to eliminate the need to include the WellContributions into the matrix (with --matrix-add-well-contributions=true) for the cusparseSolver
/// If the --matrix-add-well-contributions commandline parameter is true, this class should not be used
/// So far, StandardWell and MultisegmentWell are supported
/// StandardWells are only supported for cusparseSolver (CUDA), MultisegmentWells are supported for both cusparseSolver and openclSolver
/// A single instance (or pointer) of this class is passed to the BdaSolver.
/// For StandardWell, this class contains all the data and handles the computation. For MultisegmentWell, the vector 'multisegments' contains all the data. For more information, check the MultisegmentWellContribution class.

/// A StandardWell uses C, D and B and performs y -= (C^T * (D^-1 * (B*x)))
/// B and C are vectors, disguised as matrices and contain blocks of StandardWell::numEq by StandardWell::numStaticWellEq
/// D is a block, disguised as matrix, the square block has size StandardWell::numStaticWellEq. D is actually stored as D^-1
/// B*x and D*B*x are a vector with numStaticWellEq doubles
/// C*D*B*x is a blocked matrix with a symmetric sparsity pattern, contains square blocks with size numEq. For every columnindex i, j in StandardWell::duneB_, there is a block on (i, j) in C*D*B*x.
