# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag

# path to strip.

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. The create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option.

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify an additional
# user-defined cascading style sheet that is included after the standard
# style sheets created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule
# certain style aspects. This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET
# since it does not replace the standard style sheet and is therefor more
# robust against future updates. Doxygen will copy the style sheet file to
# the output directory.
