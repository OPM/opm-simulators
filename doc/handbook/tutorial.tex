\chapter[Tutorial]{Tutorial}\label{chp:tutorial}

\eWoms provides two sorts of models: Models which use a fully-implicit
discretization in space and time and models that use a
semi-implicit space and an explicit time discretization.

Fully-implicit models as implemented by \eWoms describe the
conservation quantities of a flow system as a system of strongly
coupled partial differential equations which is directly using a
non-linear solver. Physically, these conservation quantities are mass,
momentum and energy; Although the momentum is usually not explicitly
conserved in the context of flow models for porous media.

In section \ref{box} a short introduction to the vertex centered
finite volume scheme (VCFV or box method) used by \eWoms as the
primary spatial discretization is given.

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce how flow problems can be
solved in \eWoms.  Being a simple but representative case, an
isothermal two-phase problem (i.e. two fluid phases, one solid phase)
will be considered. The source code of these tutorials is shipped with
the \eWoms source package and can be found in the \texttt{tutorial}
directory.
