\chapter{Set-up and basic workflows}

This chapter is aimed at setting up a development environment for
\eWoms and to equip you with a rough understanding of the basic
workflows used for developing the software. We will first have a
brief look at the installation procedure; After that, we will run a
sample simulation and briefly discuss how to visualize its results.

Be aware, that this is only a very streamlined version of the \eWoms
development workflow, so make yourself confident with the tools
introduced in this section before you delve into the \Cplusplus code
in the next chapter.
