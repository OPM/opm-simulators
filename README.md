> The `opm-simulators` repository contains the OPM Flow reservoir simulator which uses automatic differentiation and standard input-formats to simulate reservoirs of industrial complexity on real assets by commercial actors. It is cooperatively developed by multiple industry-partners and academic institutions under the GPL 3 license.
> 
> Flow is a fully implicit black-oil simulators which also supports CO2 storage, H2 storage, thermal simulations, solvents, as well as polymers. It works with the Eclipse formats, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows. The automatic differentiation is implemented in [opm-common](OPM/opm-common). The manual can be found here on the OPM [home page](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=955).

## Supported Platforms
- RHEL 8+
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and 24.04 LTS
- Debian
- Mac OS X
- WSL2

[Download binaries here](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=36)


## Building from Source
`opm-simulators` Depends on:
- [opm-common](OPM/opm-common)
- [opm-grid](OPM/opm-grid)
- [Dune and all other dependencies are listed and tracked on the home page](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=239)

[Follow the build instructions on the home page](http://opm-project.org/?page_id=36).


## In-Code Documentation
In addition to providing the [manual](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=955) we also document the source code with Doxygen, using the `make doc` command.


## Reporting Issues
Issues can either be reported here on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OPM/opm-simulators/issues), or using the [OPM mailing list](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=358)

To help diagnose build errors, please provide a link to a build log together
with the issue description.

You can capture such a log from the build using the `script' utility, e.g.:

    LOGFILE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M-)build.log ;
    cmake -E cmake_echo_color --cyan --bold "Log file: $LOGFILE" ;
    script -q $LOGFILE -c 'cmake ../opm-core -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug' &&
    script -q $LOGFILE -a -c 'ionice nice make -j 4 -l 3' ||
    cat CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/CMake*.log >> $LOGFILE

The resulting file can be uploaded to for instance gist.github.com.


## Citing
To cite OPM Flow we primarily use the paper `The Open Porous Media Flow reservoir simulator` published in the `Computers & Mathematics with Applications` (CAMWA) Journal. The correctly attribute credit to later contributors, we also want the Zenodo repository containing the source code to be cited. The BibTex for both can be found below.
