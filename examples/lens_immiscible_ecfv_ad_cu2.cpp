 *
 * \brief This test is identical to the simulation of the lens problem that uses the
 *        element centered finite volume discretization in conjunction with automatic
 *        differentiation (lens_immiscible_ecfv_ad).
 *
 * The only difference is that it uses multiple compile units in order to ensure that
 * eWoms code can be used within libraries that use the same type tag within multiple
 * compile units. This file represents the second compile unit and just defines an
 * startup function for the simulator.
